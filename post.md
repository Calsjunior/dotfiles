If you seen my last post here on hyprland and caelestia shell rice. I have updated the install script and other scripts that come with it extensively!

For those you love to have their entire system to have the same color palette, but despise the puke colors (no offense) that are generated by matugen, I have synced up applications that I use to the same color theme like those of everforest, gruvbox, etc. See the attached images.

If you don't use kitty or neovim, you'll still get the benefit of dynamic wallpaper changes based on the scheme you have chosen, and vice versa!

Caelestia shell doesn't come by default with the ability for you to open >wallpaper or >scheme via keybinds, but in my dotfiles, there are scripts for those too.

Happy ricing!
